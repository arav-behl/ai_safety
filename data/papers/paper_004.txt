Title: Neural Network Architectures for Image Classification

Abstract:
We present a novel convolutional neural network architecture for image classification tasks. Our approach combines residual connections with attention mechanisms to achieve state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet. The model achieves 95.2% top-1 accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

Introduction:
Image classification remains a fundamental problem in computer vision. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled significant improvements in accuracy, but challenges remain in handling diverse image types and maintaining robustness to adversarial examples.

Methodology:
Our architecture uses a ResNet backbone with integrated self-attention modules. Training is performed using a combination of data augmentation and label smoothing to improve generalization.

Results:
We evaluate our model on ImageNet-1k and achieve 95.2% top-1 accuracy, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by 2.3 percentage points.
