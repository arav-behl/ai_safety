Title: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback: A Comprehensive Analysis

Abstract:
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become the standard approach for aligning large language models with human preferences. This paper provides a detailed analysis of RLHF methodologies, including reward modeling, policy optimization, and safety considerations. We examine how RLHF affects model behavior across different domains and identify potential failure modes.

Introduction:
The alignment problem in AI systems requires careful consideration of how models interpret and follow instructions. RLHF has shown promise in creating models that are both capable and safe, but recent work has revealed that alignment can be circumvented through various techniques. Understanding these vulnerabilities is crucial for developing more robust safety mechanisms.

Key Contributions:
1. Comprehensive survey of RLHF techniques and their effectiveness
2. Analysis of alignment failure modes in long-context scenarios
3. Evaluation of mitigation strategies for prompt injection attacks
